Here the model is a quantitative version of the statement \"a straight line separates the classes\", while the model parameters are the particular numbers describing the location and orientation of that line for our data.

This is a higher-level generalization of the well-known problem of fitting a line to data with two coordinates.\n",

For instance, k-means clustering algorithm fits a model consisting of k cluster centers; the optimal centers are assumed to be those that minimize the distance of each point from its assigned center.
